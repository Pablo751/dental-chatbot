# ü¶∑ Dentaly RAG Chatbot

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built with Streamlit and OpenAI that answers dental care questions based on content from the Dentaly US website.

## Features

- **Semantic Search**: Uses OpenAI embeddings to find relevant content
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time streaming responses from GPT-4
- **Source Citations**: Provides source URLs for transparency
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean Streamlit interface with chat history
- **Flexible API Key Input**: Supports both environment secrets and user input

## Demo

üöÄ **[Try the live demo here](https://your-app-name.railway.app)** (Replace with your Railway URL)

## How It Works

1. **Knowledge Base**: Pre-processed embeddings from Dentaly US website content
2. **Query Processing**: User questions are converted to embeddings
3. **Retrieval**: Most relevant documents are found using cosine similarity
4. **Generation**: GPT-4 generates responses based on retrieved context
5. **Citation**: Source URLs are provided with each response

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the Live Demo
Visit the deployed version and enter your OpenAI API key in the sidebar.

### Option 2: Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pablo751/dental-chatbot.git
   cd dental-chatbot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Enter your OpenAI API Key** in the sidebar when prompted.

## Configuration

### For Local Development
You can either:
- Enter your API key through the Streamlit interface (recommended for testing)
- Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file:
  ```toml
  OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
  ```

### For Production Deployment
Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable in your deployment platform.
